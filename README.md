# Python Review of data structures and algorithms

This repo contains a set of problems that I solve to keep my coding skills sharp. Feel free to make improvement. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any package. At the moment, the code is using build in libraries from python. I will upload an environment file if the libraries change.

```bash
pip install package-name
```

## Usage

If you need to import library, use command such as:

```python
import foobar
```
